# FerroX
FerroX is a massively parallel, 3D phase-field simulation framework for modeling ferroelectric materials based scalable logic devices. We  self-consistently solve the time-dependent Ginzburg Landau (TDGL) equation for ferroelectric polarization, Poisson's equation for electric potential, and semiconductor charge equation for carrier densities in semiconductor regions. The algorithm is implemented using Exascale Computing Project software framework, AMReX, which provides effective scalability on manycore and GPU-based supercomputing architectures. The code can be used for simulations of ferroelectric domain-wall induced negative capacitance (NC) effect in Metal-Ferroelectric-Insulator-Metal (MFIM) and Metal-Ferroelectric-Insulator-Semiconductor-Metal (MFISM) devices.
